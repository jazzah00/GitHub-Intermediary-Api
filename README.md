# GitHub-Intermediary-Api
An intermediary Api that is used to query GitHub's public API to retrieve a user. This api requires an authentication token to execute endpoints.
The api can generate a single-use authentication token with 1 min lifespan - this is a stand-in for those that want to implement their own forms of authentication.

This Api is built with swagger for easier usage.
